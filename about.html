        <p>Hi,<br />&nbsp;<br />I'm Charlie Calvert and I'm your teacher.</p>

        <div>
            <div>I've been working with computers and writing code in one form or another for about 30 years. I started
                out with Turbo Pascal and Delphi, spent time with Java, C++, Python, Perl, and C#.&nbsp; I've spent most
                of my career in industry, working first for Borland, then for a start-up in Silicon Valley, and for a
                few years, I was at Microsoft on the C# team as a Technical Evangelist. Over the last few years, I've
                been interested primarily in Cloud and Mobile Development with&nbsp;JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</div>
        </div>
        <p>In this class, I'm looking forward to exploring the ways we write web and mobile applications that use Cloud
            services. I'm also looking to learn new ways to use virtual machines, cloud resources, and mobile
            devices.<br />&nbsp;<br />I enjoy hiking, snow-shoeing, swimming, reading and watching movies. I also like
            to&nbsp;write. I'm known in the computer world primarily as a book author:</p>
