## West Seattle

We go.

We went to West Seattle on Friday January 20th. It was a beautiful day and we walk along the coast. 

Before getting to Alkai beach we stopped for a moment to take a picture of the city from a lookout on the road. Here is our car at the overview.

We got back in the car and drove to the waterfront. We actually stopped at a park near the waterfront and walked a block or two down to the beach. We looked at the waters of Puget Sound with Olympics in the distance.

The path ran along the edge of the beach.

Lots of condos along the shorelineit's some of them were kind of nice and most of them were pretty ugly looking.
