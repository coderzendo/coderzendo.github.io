This question is about CSS, and the OP did not include any CSS code. Here is the original question:

There is no good way to edit this "question' to make it more comprehensible. Instead I will simply explain the error the OP got and describe how to resolve it.

The **lcurlyexpected** error occurs when you leave off a left curly brace ( { ) from a CSS rule. Here is the proper syntax for a simple CSS rule:

    p {
      color: green;
    }

If you wrote this you would get a **lcurlyexpected** error:

    p 
      color: green;
    }

The problem is that there is a missing **{** after the **p** selector.
