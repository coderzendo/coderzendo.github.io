# Webpack

At the bash prompt:

``` shell
npm i webpack webpack-cli -D
```

At your project root, add this to file **webpack.config.js**:

``` javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  // The entry point file described above
  entry: './src/index.js',
  // The location of the build folder described above
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  // Optional and for development only. This provides the ability to
  // map the built code back to the original source format when debugging.
  devtool: 'eval-source-map',
};
```

In the **scripts** section of your **package.json** file:

``` json
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack --mode=development"
},
```

Then you can:

```
npm run build
```

To load the file:

``` html
<script src="bundle.js"></script>
```
